          One fine day

One fine day in the middle of the night
Two dead boys got up to fight
Back to back they faced each other
Drew their swords and shot each other
One was blind and the other couldn't see
So they chose a dummy for a referee
A blind man went to see fair play
A dumb man went to shout "hooray!"
A paralysed donkey passing by
Kicked the blind man in the eye
Knocked him through a 9in wall
Into a dry ditch and drowned them all
A deaf police heard the noise
And came to kill the two dead boys
If you don't believe this story's true
Ask the blind man he saw it too
